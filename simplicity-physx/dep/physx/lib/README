You'll have to get your own copy of the PhysX libs as I'm not sure if I'm allowed to redistribute them.

Go here to get a free* copy of the libs: https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworksdownload

*Read the terms and conditions.

Once you've got it you can copy the contents of the Bin/<architecture> and Lib/<architecture> folders here!

Be warned: PhysX forces you to use the /MT flag on Windows for all binaries in your project...
